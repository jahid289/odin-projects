        <h3> Steps ! </h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine cilantro, olive oil, lime juice, lime zest, minced garlic, chili powder, cumin, salt, and pepper in a bowl or plastic storage container. Add chicken and coat well in the marinade. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, turning chicken occasionally. </li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). </li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Remove chicken thighs from the marinade, rubbing garlic onto both sides of the chicken. Add chicken to the hot oil and cook until browned, about 4 minutes per side. Turn off burner and transfer chicken to a plate; set aside. </li>
            <li>Pour chicken stock and water into the Dutch oven, scraping the bottom of the pot with a wooden or plastic spoon to loosen any browned bits. Stir in rice, lime juice, and salt. Place chicken on top of the rice and cover with a lid. </li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Uncover and remove chicken to a plate using tongs. Stir rice from bottom to top then place the chicken back on top of the rice. </li>
            <li>Return to the oven and cook, uncovered, until all the liquid is absorbed, and the rice is soft, 15 to 18 more minutes. </li>
            <li>Transfer cooked chicken to a plate and stir 2 tablespoons chopped cilantro and 1 1/2 teaspoons lime zest into the rice. Fluff with a fork and serve with the chicken. </li>
        </ol>
