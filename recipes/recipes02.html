        <details>Cheese enchiladas are perfect for a quick and easy dinner! Filled with three types of cheese, green onions, and salsa, these enchiladas are ready to eat in just 40 minutes. Switch up the flavor by using mild, hot, or fruity salsa, or even subbing enchilada sauce. My grandma gave me this recipe.</details>
